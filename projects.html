      <br> 1. Passion Brainstorm
      <br> I created the Passion Brainstorm site as my final project for the Design Thinking & Strategy class at Boston College. For the project, we had to address a problem that students on BC's campus face and I chose the problem
      of seniors facing the big question - "What do I want to do after graduation?". It is a question that makes everyone I know stressed. I wanted to develop a solution that could help students think through their pasions
      and make it easier for them to answer this big question
      <br>
      The site has two main features: a 'passion word map'
